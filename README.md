Calculator using HTML, CSS &amp; JS
As we know that a calculator is a machine which allows us to do math operations more easily. 
For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, 
and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs.
Calculators are found everywhere. You can even build a more advanced level calculator, but we will keep it simple.
